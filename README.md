## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I focused a lot on responsibility in this project, and I'm pretty happy with the overall result. This is the first time I've been using media queries, and while I feel I have much more to learn yet, I think I've made progress.

### Continued development

In my future projects I plan on focus more on responsibility in general and continue to use a mobile-first approach, as I've found it really helpful.
